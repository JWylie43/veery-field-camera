# ================================================================ 8. AE route (daylight rig)
# The rig records outdoors only, and analog gain adds noise without adding
# light.  Strategy (revised 2026-09-20, Joe's call): the shutter does ALL the
# work, across its FULL hardware range, at unity gain throughout.
#
# UNITY GAIN: analog gain is pinned at 1.0 (this schema's gain is a linear
# multiplier, so 1.0 == no amplification == "gain 0" in dB terms). The old
# route let it reach 2.0 in the darkest scenes; that bought one stop of
# brightness for a stop of noise, and this rig only shoots lit fields. When
# 33ms at gain 1.0 is not enough light, the frame is simply dark - that is
# the accepted trade, and it is the only thing given up here.
#
# FLOOR IS THE HARDWARE FLOOR: 4 lines x 13.333us = 53.3us (see the line-time
# derivation in ROCK5T_CAMERA.md). The previous floor of 500us was never
# measured - it came from an assumed "sun ~1ms" - and left ~3.2 stops of the
# sensor's range unreachable, which is how a sunlit field can clip with AE
# already at its fastest allowed shutter. A shorter shutter cannot add motion
# blur, so there is nothing to protect by limiting this end.
#
# Range is now 53.3us -> 33ms = 9.3 stops of shutter, all noise-free, versus
# the old 4-stop budget. 8ms is kept as a route waypoint (the blur knee for
# game footage) but is no longer a ceiling that hands off to gain.
