placeholder_extrinsics.py - write a stereo_extrinsics.json from the rig's
DESIGN numbers, so the stitch pipeline can run before the housing exists.

    python3 placeholder_extrinsics.py --yaw 74 --baseline-mm 60

This is a stand-in, not a measurement. It assumes the cameras are perfectly
mounted: pure yaw, no pitch, no roll, and a baseline straight along X. A real
rig is off by a degree or two in every axis, and those errors are exactly what
the stitch seam is sensitive to - so re-run the real calibration
(snap_pair.sh + calibrate.py --use-intrinsics) once the cameras are fixed in
the printed housing, and overwrite this file.

What it is good for: getting the whole pipeline running end to end - pairing,
warping, seam, encode - so the only thing left to change later is the numbers.

Sign convention: yaw is the rotation from the LEFT camera to the RIGHT one
about the vertical axis. If the stitched pano comes out with the two views
swapped or diverging, negate --yaw.
